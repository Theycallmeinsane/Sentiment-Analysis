# Sentiment-Analysis
Achievement Brief:

I successfully conducted sentiment analysis on the IMDB review dataset using a diverse range of methodologies, showcasing versatility and proficiency in natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Here's a brief overview of the achievement:

1. **Approach Diversity**: Employed various approaches including Lexicon-Based, Bag of Words, GloVe Embedding, and Custom Word Embedding. This multi-faceted strategy allowed for comprehensive analysis, leveraging the strengths of each method to extract sentiment from text data effectively.

2. **State-of-the-Art Techniques**: Implemented fine-tuning on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) such as GPT-2, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT. This advanced technique involved adapting these models to the specific task of sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset, enhancing accuracy and performance.

3. **Custom Word Embedding**: Developed custom word embedding techniques tailored to the specific characteristics of the IMDB dataset. This bespoke approach enabled the extraction of sentiment features unique to the movie reviews, enhancing the overall sentiment analysis accuracy.

4. **Insight Generation**: Generated actionable insights from the sentiment analysis results, providing valuable information for understanding audience sentiment towards movies on the IMDB platform. These insights can inform decision-making processes for filmmakers, producers, and movie studios, aiding in content development and marketing strategies.

Overall, this achievement demonstrates a robust understanding of NLP techniques and a commitment to leveraging cutting-edge methodologies to extract meaningful insights from textual data. The comprehensive approach and insightful analysis contribute to advancing the field of sentiment analysis and its applications in understanding audience perceptions in the movie industry.
